This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails and you encounter an error message related to the Android build system, Gradle, but the exact error message can vary. This is often difficult to debug because the underlying cause isn't always obvious within the Expo logs.  It might be related to dependencies, environment issues, or problems with the Android build configuration.

Example of a general error (the specific error message will vary):
```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
