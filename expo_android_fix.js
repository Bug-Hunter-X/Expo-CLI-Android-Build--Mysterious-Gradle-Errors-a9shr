This file contains a similar project structure as the bug file, but with added steps to potentially address the root cause of the issue.  Specific solutions will vary depending on the exact error received.

```javascript
// expo_android_fix.js (This might need adjustments depending on your project)
// ... your Expo project code ...
```

The solution focuses on best practices for debugging such errors:

1. **Cleaning the project:** Execute `expo prebuild --clean` before each build attempt.
2. **Checking and updating dependencies:** Ensure all packages in `package.json` are updated using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
3. **Checking Gradle version compatibility:** Verify correct Gradle version in `android/build.gradle`.
4. **Validating Android environment:** Re-check Android SDK and NDK configurations and path settings. 
5. **Detailed error log analysis:** Don't dismiss any part of the error message during the build. Each line may be useful for the resolution. 
6. **Updating Expo CLI:**  Execute `npm update -g expo-cli` to use the latest features and bug fixes.
7. **Invalidate caches/restart:** Try invalidating caches and restarting your IDE (Android Studio, VS Code, etc.) or system.
